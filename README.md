# PWM

A PWM example could be seen in the following image:

PWM (pulse width modulation) is a method to drive analog devices by digital systems (microcontroller, fpga etc.).

By changing PWM behavior a designer able to drive analog device by different power. 
PWM behavior could be change with changing two things: duty cycle and PWM frequency.
Frequency of PWM: Speed of how many duty-cycle is going to happen in a unit time.
Duty Cycle: With what percentage of period, PWM signal is going to stay high.    

The larger the duty cycle the brighter the leds (or the faster the motors etc.).
